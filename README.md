***Under Construction

An app that has a bunch of little apps that have basic functionality. Built with HTML, CSS, and jQuery. 

I wanted to put a couple small applications on my repository that have very basic functionality like to do lists, a calculator, and a mini game among other things. I figured, instead of making a bunch of individual repositories, I'll make an application that has different pages that will take you to mini applications.
